## Getting Started

### Development

```
git clone https://github.com/vctrblck/whispers.git
cd whispers
npm run setup
```

### Running the server

1. Run a local HTTP server in this project directory.(python -m http.server)
2. Open a browser.
3. Request `<server-address>:<port-number>/index.html` from browser.

### Bugs

Installing packages with NPM deletes the `three` library, since I have not used NPM to install it. Just run `npm run setup` again (if `three` has been removed).
